# dum

> **dum** replaces `npm run`.

## Install

If you are a Rust user:

```bash
cargo install dum
```

Or [download a release](https://github.com/egoist/dum/releases) and move it to `/usr/local/bin` manually.

PR welcome for adding a shell script so you can install `dum` with a single `curl` command.

## TODO
